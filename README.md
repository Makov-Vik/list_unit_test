# list_unit_test

# What is it?
The project is the:
1. creation of a list that has basic methods: add a node, remove a node, find out the length of the list, and so on.
2. Writing tests for all list methods
3. Preparing CI GitHub Actions

# Technology Stack:
* NodeJs
* Jest

# Calculating my variant:
My passbook number is 0520. If we divide 520/2, the remainder of the division will be 0. Therefore, I have a circular one-way list
